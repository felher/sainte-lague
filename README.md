## Sainte-Laguë

Hi there, this is a small program to calculate the allotment of resources
using the Sainte-Laguë method. It is used, among other countries of course,
by Germany to assign seats for their parliament or the parliament of the
European Union.

You can build it yourself doing
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
and in another terminal
```
sbt
~fastLinkJS
```

You can also find it [here](https://sainte-lague.sabix2.sabix.eu)

It is build with [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and
[Laminar](https://laminar.dev), so go check them out.
